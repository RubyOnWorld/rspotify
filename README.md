## Installation
Since this crate is still under developing, it isn't pushed to
[crates.io](https://crates.io/), but it is close to finish. Just be patient
## Examples

If you have a use case you are intertested in, you could check the
[examples](./examples), which has all kinds of examples. For example, If you
want to get Spotify catalog information about an artist's top 10 tracks by
country, you could check [current_user_recently_played](./examples/current_user_recently_played). This
is the example code:

``` rust
extern crate rspotify;

use rspotify::spotify::client::Spotify;
use rspotify::spotify::util::get_token;
use rspotify::spotify::oauth2::{SpotifyClientCredentials, SpotifyOAuth};

fn main() {
    // Set client_id and client_secret in .env file or
    // export CLIENT_ID="your client_id"
    // export CLIENT_SECRET="secret"
    // export REDIRECT_URI=your-direct-uri

    // Or set client_id, client_secret,redirect_uri explictly
    // let oauth = SpotifyOAuth::default()
    //     .client_id("this-is-my-client-id")
    //     .client_secret("this-is-my-client-secret")
    //     .redirect_uri("http://localhost:8888/callback")
    //     .build();

    let mut oauth = SpotifyOAuth::default()
        .scope("user-read-recently-played")
        .build();
    match get_token(&mut oauth) {
        Some(token_info) => {
            let client_credential = SpotifyClientCredentials::default()
                .token_info(token_info)
                .build();
            // Or set client_id and client_secret explictly
            // let client_credential = SpotifyClientCredentials::default()
            //     .client_id("this-is-my-client-id")
            //     .client_secret("this-is-my-client-secret")
            //     .build();
            let spotify = Spotify::default()
                .client_credentials_manager(client_credential)
                .build();
            let history = spotify.current_user_recently_played(10);
            println!("{:?}", history);
        }
        None => println!("auth failed"),
    };

}

```
